### layout
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

• Block-level box starts on a new line and act as the main building blocks like  : `<h1>` , `<p>` , `<ul>`
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text like : `<b>` , `<i>` , `<img>`

• Thers is 3 positioning schemes allows us to control the layout of page :
1. Normal flow
2. Relative Positioning
3. Absolute positioning

• We can use box offset To indicate where a box should be positioned, and maybe either floating or fixed postioning

• The `float` property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing
element as possible. it has many values such s right , left 

• `clear` property : no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take
 the following value: left ,right ,none, both
