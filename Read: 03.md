####  HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

HTML provides us with three different types of lists:

1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. we use `<ol>` tag the `<li> `for listing element

2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point  `<ul>` tag the `<li> `for listing element

3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms. like `<dt>` , `<dd>` , `<dl>`

####  Boxes 
Pixles is most popular method to specify the size of boxes 
because they allow designers to accurately control their size.

we can use max/min-height or max/min-width to control the size of the box .
Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance :
1. Border 
2.  margin : Margins sit outside the edge of the border.
3. padding : Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

• border-width
is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given
in pixels or using one of the following values: thin,medium ,thic

• border-style 
control the style of a border using  This property can take the following values : (dotted ,soild,dashed,double,groove)


• border-color
specify the color of a border using either RGB values 

Display in CSS there is many options :
1.inline: act like an inline element
2. block : This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.
3. inline-block : This causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, while retaining other 
features of a block-level element

#### Javascript 

##### ARRAYS :
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain.

The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets with commas betwwen them.

#### Loops 
Loops check a condition. if it true a code block will run and then check the condition will be checked again and if still true the code block will run again. it still working until the conditions return false.

there are three common types of loops:
1. For: if we need to run a code a specific number of times
2. While if we do not know how many times the code should run.
3. While do is similar to while loop but it always run the statement inside the curly braces al least once even if the condition evaluates to false
