# JavaScript Summuary 

JAVASCRIPT is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal; these scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step. and to write these sccripts we need to state our goal and then set the tasks that needto be completed 

 Browsers may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts, It makes the webpage  more interactive by Access and modifying content (text, element, attribute  )
 And Set up Rules. It is just any language you need to grip vocabulary that the word which computer understands, and the syntax is a set of vocabulary which make instruction.

slideshows, forms, reload part of the page, filtering data are Examples of JavaScript in the browser while slideshows can display several different images or HTML pages.
and forms are validating forms.  

To write a script firstly we need to specify our goal and then list the tasks we need to complete in order. we can follow these steps to make it easier:
1. Define the goal! 
2. Design the script
3. code each step

Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language that the computer understands and follows. We need to learn to think like a computer because they solve tasks differently than we think!
